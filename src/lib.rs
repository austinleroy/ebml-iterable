//! This crate provides an iterator and a serializer for [EBML][EBML] files.  Its primary goal is to provide typed iteration and serialization as lightly and quickly as possible.
//!
//! [EBML][EBML] stands for Extensible Binary Meta-Language and is somewhat of a
//! binary version of XML. It's used for container formats like [WebM][webm] or
//! [MKV][mkv].
//!
//! # Important - Specifications
//! The iterator contained in this crate is spec-agnostic and requires a specification implementing the [`specs::EbmlSpecification`] and [`specs::EbmlTag`] traits to read files.  Typically, you would only use this crate to implement a custom specification - most often you would prefer a crate providing an existing specification, like [webm-iterable][webm-iterable].
//!
//! Implementing custom specifications can be made less painful and safer by enabling the `"derive-spec"` feature flag in this crate and using the [`#[ebml_specification]`](https://docs.rs/ebml-iterable-specification-derive/latest/ebml_iterable_specification_derive/attr.ebml_specification.html) macro.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! There is currently only one optional feature in this crate, but that may change over time as needs arise.
//!
//! * **derive-spec** -
//!     When enabled, this provides the [`#[ebml_specification]`](https://docs.rs/ebml-iterable-specification-derive/latest/ebml_iterable_specification_derive/attr.ebml_specification.html) attribute macro to simplify implementation of the [`EbmlSpecification`][`specs::EbmlSpecification`] and [`EbmlTag`][`specs::EbmlTag`] traits.  This introduces dependencies on [`syn`](https://crates.io/crates/syn), [`quote`](https://crates.io/crates/quote), and [`proc-macro2`](https://crates.io/crates/proc-macro2), so expect compile times to increase a little.
