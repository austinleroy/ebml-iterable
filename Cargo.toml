description = "This crate provides an iterator over EBML encoded data.  The items provided by the iterator are Tags as defined in EBML.  The iterator is spec-agnostic and requires a specification implementing specific traits to read files.  Typically, you would only use this crate to implement a custom specification - most often you would prefer a crate providing an existing specification, like `webm-iterable`."
